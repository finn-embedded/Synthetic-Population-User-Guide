Before downloading the scripts in this repository, it is important to
set things up appropriately.

# 1) Folder Structure

- When setting your working directory in dataPrep script, it is useful
  to have all the scripts, data, and output folders within this
  directory.

  - For example, the working directory could be a folder containing
    separate folders for ‘data’, ‘scripts’, and ‘output’. This makes
    life easier when editing code, as you will only need to specify the
    folder you want (rather than the full file path each time).

# 2) Downloading data

## Synthetic Population

- To download the Synthetic Population data set, go to the [UK Data
  Service
  website](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=9277).
  Once downloaded, save it to the ‘data’ folder in your working
  directory.

## Understanding Society Data

- Visit the [Understanding Society
  website](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/), where all survey
  data is available, along with all the information you will need to get
  started with the data.

- Please refer to Table 1 in the README file when considering which
  variables to include in your analysis with the Synthetic Population.
